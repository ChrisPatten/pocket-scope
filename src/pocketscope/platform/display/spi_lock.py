"""Shared SPI bus lock for display + touch drivers.

The ILI9341 display (CE0) and XPT2046 touch (CE1) each open their own
spidev device. A mechanical bump on a loose breadboard can momentarily
float chip select lines causing interleaved bytes if both attempt
transfers concurrently. A process-level reâ€‘entrant lock keeps transfers
atomic relative to each other, reducing protocol corruption and spurious
panel lockups.
